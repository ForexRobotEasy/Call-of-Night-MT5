## Set up and installation function

The `SetupAndInstall()` function is responsible for setting up and installing the software. This includes configuring various parameters and settings required for the proper functioning of the robot.

## Trade function

The `Trade()` function contains the code for executing trades on all supported currency pairs from a single chart. It implements various trading strategies and techniques to maximize profitability. Additionally, it includes the implementation of pending orders to reduce slippage.

## Transaction function

The `CloseTransactions()` function handles the closing of all transactions within the specified time frame. It also implements stop loss, take profit, and limits on the life of each trade to manage risk and protect capital.

## Main program

The main program consists of three key functions: `OnInit()`, `OnTick()`, and `OnDeinit()`.

- `OnInit()` is called when the program is initialized. It calls the `SetupAndInstall()` function to set up and install the software.

- `OnTick()` is called on every tick of the market. It executes the `Trade()` and `CloseTransactions()` functions to perform trading operations.

- `OnDeinit()` is called when the program is deinitialized. It is responsible for cleaning up and releasing any resources used by the program.
